                    "Work in Progress" is my contribution to "We Have a Few Thoughts;" a collaborative feminist poster exhibition between twenty-one Richmond-based designers, each poster reflecting the designer's personal connection to feminism. The exhibition was displayed in the <a href="https://branchmuseum.org/" targer="_blank">Branch Museum of Design</a> from January 23 to February 20, 2024.

                    This poster reflects the relationship that the beauty industry has on the way that women view their own body. There is an expectation for women to spend their own money maintaining their appearance to meet beauty standards - with the implication that a woman in her default state is not feminine, but something that must be altered, and "finished" before it meets an arbitrary definition of womanhood.
